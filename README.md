This is the ReadMe for the Bluetooth Lockbox, created in the Fall of 2015.
The Lockbox serves the utility of a mechanically operated safe whose password
is transmitted via bluetooth from a phone or computer.

In this repository are two Processing files (written in a derivative of C),
one to configure the device to be a Bluetooth recipient/slave, and the other
to handle bluetooth input and take appropriate actions to lock or unlock the
device with a Servo motor.
